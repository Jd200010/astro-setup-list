The Razer Huntsman is a 60% keyboard that I primarily use for home use / gaming.

The small form factor of the keyboard is perfect for if you are trying to conserve space on your desk. The sound of pressing the keys is very quiet which is nice for gaming if you do not want to hear constant key press noise.
