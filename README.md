# My list of the different tech that I use.
This is a website I have been making to learn Astro. It will hold information on the tech that I am currently using or tech that I have found very useful.

## Appreciation
I would like to take a moment to thank [Takuya Matsuyama](https://github.com/craftzdog) for the content that he creates on his [youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) He has been a big inspiration and motivator for me. I have been learning Astro by reading through his own [repo](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-uses) for this type of work.
